# 📊 Stock Price Prediction using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Description  
This project aims to predict stock prices using various machine learning models. The key steps include:
- Data Preprocessing
- Feature Engineering
- Model Training & Evaluation
- Performance Analysis & Visualization

## 📌 How to Run the Project  
Follow these steps to set up and run the project:

1️⃣ **Clone the repository:**  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/stock-price-prediction.git
cd stock-price-prediction
```

2️⃣ **Install dependencies:**  
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3️⃣ **Run Jupyter Notebook:**  
```bash
jupyter notebook
```

4️⃣ **Open and execute the notebook** `stock-market-analysis-structured.ipynb`.

## 📌 Model Performance  
The models are evaluated using the following metrics:
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**
- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**
- **R² Score (Coefficient of Determination)**

📌 **Best Model Selected:** **Linear Regression** (as it shows no overfitting and has balanced performance).
